# Illustrator\*

\* Name to change in the future

This is a project I'm working on in conjunction with
[YASH](https://github.com/JoeBobMiles/YASH) to build a web-based vector
graphics editor. This project is mostly intended to provide both a reference
use case for YASH as well as give me a place to stress test its API.

Beyond these humble goals, however, I do dream of one day producing an
application that takes on Adobe Illustrator and InkScape.
